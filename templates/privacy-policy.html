        </p>

        <b>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website</b>

        <p>
            If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
            or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, provided that special categories of data according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are
            processed. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
            processing is also
            carried out based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access
            to
            information on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also carried out based
            on § 25 para. 1
            TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract
            or for
            pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process
            your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data
            processing
            may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the
            relevant
            legal basis in each case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <b>Recipients of Personal Data</b>

        <p>
            In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also
            necessary to transmit personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external
            parties if
            this is necessary within the framework of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g.,
            transfer
            of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the
            transfer, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on
            personal data of our
            customers based on a valid contract for data processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for
            joint
            processing is concluded.
        </p>

        <b>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</b>

        <p>
            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke any consent you
            have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation
            remains
            unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>

        <b>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</b>

        <p>
            IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT
            TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO
            PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND
            IN THIS
            PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
            DEMONSTRATE
            COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE
            PROCESSING
            IS FOR THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
            <br>
            <br>
            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME
            TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS
            RELATED
            TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL THEN NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING
            PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
        </p>

        <b>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</b>

        <p>
            In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
            authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
            alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or
            judicial
            remedies.
        </p>

        <b>Right to Data Portability</b>

        <p>
            You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in the performance of a contract
            automatically delivered to you or a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the
            direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically
            feasible.
        </p>

        <b>Information, Correction, and Deletion</b>

        <p>
            Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
            about your stored personal data, its origin, and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if
            necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose
            and for
            further questions on the subject of personal data.
        </p>

        <b>Right to Restrict Processing</b>

        <p>
            You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at
            anytime for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
            <br>
            <br>
            If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For
            the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
            personal data.
            If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing
            instead of deletion.
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you
            have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
            If you have filed an objection according to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must
            be carried out. As long as it is not yet determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request
            the
            restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from being stored – may only
            be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
            protection
            of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the
            European
            Union or a member state.
        </p>

        <b>SSL or TLS Encryption</b>

        <p>
            For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries
            that you
            send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted

            your browser line.
            If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

            <br>
            <br>
            The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited
            advertising and information materials is hereby rejected. The operators of the sites expressly reserve the
            right to take
            legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
